# Identification of Biomedical Data Science Learner Persons

Implications and Lessons Learned for Domain-Specific Data Science Curriculum

## What are Personas?

- Come from product design
- Detailed description of an imaginary person
- Embodies assumptions of the user and product
- Cannot and should not represent every possible user

## Teaching Tech Together: The Rules {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. **Be kind: all else is details.**
2. Remember that you are not your learners…
3. …that most people would rather fail than change…
4. …and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.
5. Never teach alone.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
7. Make every mistake a lesson.
8. Remember that no lesson survives first contact with learners…
9. …that every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner…
10. …and that nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
