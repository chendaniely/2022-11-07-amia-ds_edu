# Identification of Biomedical Data Science Learner Persons

## Why use personas in education?

- Minimize **discrepancies** on how people understand and communicate about users
- Make implicit assumptions **explicit**
- Stay focused on the **users** (user centric design)

## Biomedical Learner Persona Survey Conclusions

1. First step in backward lesson decision: identify learners (learner personas)
2. Have a way to create learner personas for the biomedical data science
3. Survey tool validation allows others to create their own learner personas or help add to the current set of personas created in this study
4. Identification of biomedical data science learner personas informs curriculum design

## Learning Material Effectiveness Conclusions

1. Learner Personas and Concept Maps Help Curate Lesson Content
2. Language-Agnostic Lessons Guide Presentation Order
3. Data Science Lessons Differ from Computer Science Lessons
4. Intermediate Materials will be difficult to plan
5. Long-Term Practice is important
6. Work on Relevant Problems Solidify skills
7. Communities of Practice Provide Ongoing Learning and Scalability


# Practical Implications

## How Can I Use This Information?

- Can explore your own (patient) data
- Can work on curating your own data

- Potentially faster research-question cycle

- Continuing education

## Design Your Own Materials

Create your own learner personas:

1. Identify who your learners are
2. Figure out what they need and want to know
3. Plan a guided learning tract

- Use the surveys I‚Äôve made with the data I‚Äôve published

## Teaching Knowledge

- Content Knowledge: What the instructor knows
- Curricular Knowledge: Curriculum materials to teach the content

- Pedagogical Content Knowledge: How to teach the content
