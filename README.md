## Description

A panel of leaders in innovative educational approaches will discuss the opportunities and challenges of data science education outside of the traditional classroom setting. The pandemic has accelerated a trend toward new and innovative approaches to biomedical education, especially in the move to online learning. Online-first education is not constrained by the same factors as classroom education. It can be flexible, efficient, and personalizable in new ways â€” features that are especially crucial for supporting ongoing learning for busy informatics professionals, clinicians, and researchers. Moreover, online content that is shared openly can be reused and remixed for new applications, including improving access for people from underserved communities both locally and globally, as well as for incorporation into undergraduate and graduate education.

Attendees will come away with:

- a sense of the unique opportunities inherent in online-first education outside of a traditional classroom setting
- practical strategies for building, delivering, and sharing innovative educational content for data science, and
- reasons to build open and shareable materials, and tools to do so.
