# Data Science in the Biomedical Science

## Data Science Programs Are Too General

- Data science programs target **single broad audiences**
- Opportunity to **branch out** to different disciplines
- Democratization of data science education enables more **domain specific** learning materials


## Informatics Interest Outpace Opportunities

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/020-ds-biomed//banerjee-2015-interest_outpace_opportunities.png")
```

- Students who are interested in a clinical informatics related career
- Not aware of training opportunities
- Need to increase: quantity, quality, and publicity

## Backward Design Learning Materials

1. Identify your learners (learner persona)
2. Plan out your lesson content (concept maps)
3. Define overall goal (summative assessment)
4. Break down the goal (formative assessment)
5. Outline the course
6. Write a summary of the course

# Identification of Biomedical Data Science Learner Persons

Implications and Lessons Learned for Domain-Specific Data Science Curriculum

## What are Personas?

- Come from product design
- Detailed description of an imaginary person
- Embodies assumptions of the user and product
- Cannot and should not represent every possible user

::: footnote
- Pruitt J, Adlin T. The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design. 1st edition. Morgan Kaufmann; 2006.
:::

## Why use personas in education?

- Minimize **discrepancies** on how people understand and communicate about users
- Make implicit assumptions **explicit**
- Stay focused on the **users** (user centric design)

## Creating a "Wrong" Persona

- Still backed by data
- "Product"is still consistent
- Personas are a work in progress

## Biomedical Learner Persona Survey Conclusions

1. First step in backward lesson decision: identify learners (learner personas)
2. Have a way to create learner personas for the biomedical data science
3. Survey tool validation allows others to create their own learner personas or help add to the current set of personas created in this study
4. Identification of biomedical data science learner personas informs curriculum design

# Assessing the Efficacy of Domain-Specific Data Science Curriculum in the Biomedical Sciences

How Learner Personas Can Guide Educational Needs in the Short-Term and Long-Term

## Backward Design

1. Identify your learners (learner persona)
2. Plan out your lesson content (concept maps)
3. Define overall goal (summative assessment)
4. Break down the goal (formative assessment)
5. Outline the the course
6. Write a summary of the course

## Learning Material Effectiveness Conclusions

1. Learner Personas and Concept Maps Help Curate Lesson Content
2. Language-Agnostic Lessons Guide Presentation Order
3. Data Science Lessons Differ from Computer Science Lessons
4. Intermediate Materials will be difficult to plan
5. Long-Term Practice is important
6. Work on Relevant Problems Solidify skills
7. Communities of Practice Provide Ongoing Learning and Scalability


# Practical Implications

## How Can I Use This Information?

- Can explore your own (patient) data
- Can work on curating your own data

- Potentially faster research-question cycle

- Continuing education

## Design Your Own Materials

Create your own learner personas:

1. Identify who your learners are
2. Figure out what they need and want to know
3. Plan a guided learning tract

- Use the surveys I’ve made with the data I’ve published

## Teaching Knowledge

- Content Knowledge: What the instructor knows
- Curricular Knowledge: Curriculum materials to teach the content

- Pedagogical Content Knowledge: How to teach the content

## Overall Conclusions {.smaller}

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
- Objective way of backward design lesson development
- Domain-specific workshops seem beneficial to meet learning objectives
- Data science have different set of programming skills
- Long-term learning is more important
- Formative + summative assessments in long-term learning
- "10,000 hour rule",  "deliberate practice", "forgetting curve"

## Teaching Tech Together: The Rules {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

1. **Be kind: all else is details.**
2. Remember that you are not your learners…
3. …that most people would rather fail than change…
4. …and that ninety percent of magic consists of knowing one extra thing.
5. Never teach alone.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

6. Never hesitate to sacrifice truth for clarity.
7. Make every mistake a lesson.
8. Remember that no lesson survives first contact with learners…
9. …that every lesson is too short for the teacher and too long for the learner…
10. …and that nobody will be more excited about the lesson than you are.
